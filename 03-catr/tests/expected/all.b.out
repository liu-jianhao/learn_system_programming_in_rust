     1	The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
     1	Don't worry, spiders,
     2	I keep house
     3	casually.
     1	The bustle in a house
     2	The morning after death
     3	Is solemnest of industries
     4	Enacted upon earth,â€”

     5	The sweeping up the heart,
     6	And putting love away
     7	We shall not want to use again
     8	Until eternity.
